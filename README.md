# DrEcco (2020)
## General game guidelines
All games that need to be uploaded on the website must implement the following
items:

1. The game must be submitted as a zip file, which unzips into a separate directory. (I will provide the script to unzip and add your game to the database, more on that in Development Process.)
2. The main entry point to the game must be index.php. The CIMS server only runs PHP scripts, so your game's main page will have to be in PHP. From there, you can probably run the game via Javascript. (See the examples in /games/)

I have copied the current server and games over to this github repository. If you want to take a look at the code. I can also provide you a zip of the whole thing over email if you want. (mfo254 [at] nyu.edu )
You can see the current games in /games/ and use them for interface etc.

## Development Process
I think the best way to go about this is to build your own copy of Dr.Ecco website, following this guide. Then develop your game using your copy, test it play it etc.

After you are done with developing the game, you can send me \*.zip of your game folder which will unzip to a folder with **same name** (*without space* is preferred :smile: ).


## Updatind the Dr.Ecco page
I will take care of the rest. I will host the game on my copy of [Dr.Ecco](https://cims.nyu.edu/~mfo254/hps/), make sure everything is good to go and finally update the real [Dr.Ecco](https://cims.nyu.edu/drecco2016/).
